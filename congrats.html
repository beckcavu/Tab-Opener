    <h1>Woah, looks like you figured it</h1><br>
    You likely used 1 of these ways you figured out the Riddle
    <h1>(1) You used the hint</h1>
    you tried to make a button named Unlock with links to The Past, The Present, The Future, exactly what the hint says....OR
    <h1>(2) You did some scavenging</h1>
    and did at least 5 things:
    <li>
        Noticed some oddly named variables floating around
    </li>
    <li>
        went wayyyy down in the file to find an incomprehensible function
    </li>
    <li>
        noticed that there was actually a few clues inside of that function
    </li>
    <li>
        connected the previously-noticed, oddly named variables to the function
    </li>
    <li>
        Understood the code structure enough to figure out, make a button named Unlock with Links to The Past, The Present, The Future
    </li>
<br>
    If you did either of these or neither of these, please, email me, beckcav1@gmail.com. I'll be waiting. We can talk about your success and continue the conversation.

    You deserve this: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PmwjZWKhBOkl6ZBroJWzkPYDMR6xKXJA/view?usp=sharing">Congratulations</a>
